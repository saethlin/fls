## fls
A nearly-POSIX-compliant and libc-less `ls` that's smaller, faster, and prettier than GNU's<sup>1</sup>.

[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) and [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd) are both great `ls`-like Rust programs, but they're slower than the system `ls` and about 10x the code size. Plus you can't actually replace your `ls` with one of them, because some software relies on parsing the output of `ls`. But even as a user experience improvement, I think other projects tell the wrong story; modern software does not need to be larger or slower.

<sup>1</sup>I don't mean to rag on GNU's `ls`, but as far as I can tell it's the closest thing along the metrics I value.

## Wall time benchmarks, run on an Ubuntu 22.04 AWS instance with `perf stat -r100`
|          | --color=never -R / > /dev/null | --color=always -R / | --color=auto ~ | --color=auto -l ~ |
| ---------| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| `fls`    | 0.31 s                         | 1.9 s               | 0.68 ms        | 0.8 ms            |
| GNU `ls` | 0.40 s                         | 3.0 s               | 1.6 ms         | 4.3 ms            |
| `eza`    | 3.3 s                          | 6.7 s               | 1.8 ms         | 5.3 ms            |
| `lsd`    | 7.5 s                          | 10 s                | 4.4 ms         | 5.1 ms            |

These do not cover all reasonable combinations of options, but if you can find a combination of flags for which `fls` is slower than any alternatives, please open an issue.

Note that `fls` will crush GNU `ls` on tiny workloads for the same reason that an `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` hello world program is faster than an `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` hello world: glibc is dynamically linked and unconditionally runs a lot of global initialization code before `main`. Perhaps those are good things to do for programs in general. You can decide for yourself.

## "libc-less"

`fls` does not link to anything. The (stripped) `fls` executable is smaller than GNU's (stripped) `ls` executable, even though some of the code that powers GNU's is in another file.

## smaller _and_ faster?

The biggest impact on code size is `#![no_std]`, because the standard library's runtime is relatively large. Most individual components of the standard library are a totally reasonable size, but the code for generating backtraces is huge and as far as I can tell `#![no_std]` is the only way to get rid of it. The rest of the code size was trimmed down mostly by running the excellent tool [`cargo bloat`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat) to identify places to replace generics with runtime dispatch, and just manually reviewing the code to factor out repeated code patterns.

In terms of speed, `fls` is _probably_ faster than GNU's `ls` because it doesn't use the POSIX interfaces for listing files. We directly call `getdents64` and parse the output, instead of juggling calls to `read_dir`. And since we're calling `getdents64`, we get access to the optional directory entry type information, which usually lets us omit a number of `stat` calls, which can be expensive relative to other filesystem syscalls.
I say _probably_ because `fls` has always been faster than GNU's `ls`. The original goal was just to use `getdents64` directly (see below), and as soon as I had a working prototype, it was faster than the competition.

## `--color=auto`

`fls` has the same interpretation as GNU ls for `--color=always` and `--color=never`, but under `--color=auto`, `fls` will _only_ apply colors based on file extension and the information available from `getdents64`, which is optional. Thus, the coloring of `fls --color=auto` is unpredictable, but you get _some_ coloring of output without any expensive `stat` calls. `fls` was originally developed when my dev environment was a compute node with an HPC filesystem, and `ls --color=always` on large directories could take seconds to minutes. `fls --color=auto` provides the same colors in those directories, in the blink of an eye. Thus, `--color=auto` is the assumed if no arguments are provided and stdout is a terminal.

## Sorting

In the absence of any options, `fls` sorts names using a comparsion function similar to `ls -v`, which attempts to treat runs of digits as a single number. You don't need to pad numbers in filenames to a fixed width to make them display in the intuitive order.

## POSIX features:

- [x] -A do not list implied `.` and `..`
- [x] -C list entries in columns
- [x] -F append an indicator to entries
- [x] -H follow symlinks when provided on the command line
- [x] -L always follow symlinks
- [x] -R recurse into subdirectories
- [x] -S sort by size
- [x] -a do not ignore entries whose names begin with `.`
- [x] -c sort by ctime
- [x] -d list directories themselves, not their contents
- [x] -f do not sort
- [x] -g long format but without owner
- [x] -i print each entry's inode
- [ ] -k pretend block size is 1024 bytes
- [x] -l long format
- [x] -m single row, separated by `, `
- [x] -n long format but list uid and gid instead of names
- [x] -o long format but without groups
- [x] -p append an indicator to directories
- [ ] -q replace non-printable characters with `?`
- [x] -r reverse sorting order
- [x] -s print size of each file in blocks
- [x] -t sort by modification time
- [x] -u sort by access time
- [ ] -x sort entries across rows
- [x] -1 list one entry per line
